SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes all the contexts that PowerTab understands when tab expanding.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    ...


  PATHS
      Paths are the default context that PowerTab can handle. Any PSDrive path
      will work and relative paths will be preserved.

          .\
          HKLM:\


  COMMANDS
      PowerTab can complete the name of Powershell cmdlets, functions and
      aliases given hints. PowerTab will look for the "<VERB>-" pattern for
      commands. Adding a "%" character to the end of the search string will
      force PowerTab to search for any type of command (cmdlet, function,
      script, or application).

          Get-
          %
          add%


  COMMAND PARAMETERS
      Command parameter names can be expaned for cmdlets, functions and
      scripts. PowerTab will also detect the corresponding command to the
      current cursor location.

          Get-ChildItem -
          Get-Process | Format-Table -


  VARIABLE NAMES
      Powertab can expand the names of variables, including quoting with "{"
      and "}" as needed.

          $
          $error


  VARIABLE PROPERTIES AND METHODS
      Properties and methods on objects stored in variables can be accessed
      with PowerTab.

          $error.g


  VARIABLE STATIC METHODS
      Static properties and methods of objects stored in variables can also be
      accessed.

          $error::


  VARIABLES BY SCOPE
      PowerTab will respect scope when expanding variable names with a scope.

          $global:


  VARIABLES BY TYPE
      Variable references to items on other PSDrives can also be expanded in
      PowerTab.

          $alias:
          $function:


  NATIVE COMMANDS
      To tab expand the names of native commands and executables, add the "!"
      character to the end of the search string (that character will be removed
      from the results).

          !
          net!


  HISTORY
      PowerTab supports expanding command history in the same way as the
      default tab expansion in PowerShell, using the "#" character to lead off
      the search string. Additionally, PowerTab supports wildcards in the
      search string.

          #
          #cd
          #12
